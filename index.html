    <h2>about console</h2>
    <p>Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their 
        JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you insert an expression like 
        console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your 
        JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to
        the Console. For example, suppose that you're in the process of writing the HTML and JavaScript
         for a page</p>

            <p>The Console can be used to log information as part of the JavaScript development
               process, as well as allow you to interact with a web page by carrying out 
               JavaScript expressions within the page's context. Essentially, the Console 
               provides you with the ability to write, manage, and monitor JavaScript on demand.</p>
